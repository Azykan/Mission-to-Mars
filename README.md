# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project
-Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Resources and Before Start Notes:
-Data Source: Mission_to_Mars.ipynb, app.py, scraping.py and index.html
-Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
-Software: MongoDB, Python , Visual Studio Code, Flask 

## HTML Keys
- Tables in HTML are basically made up of many smaller containers. The main container is the <table /> tag. Inside the table is <tbody />, which is the body of the table—the headers, columns, and rows.
- <tr /> is the tag for each table row. Within that tag, the table data is stored in <td /> tags. This is where the columns are established.
